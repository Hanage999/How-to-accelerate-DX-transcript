Ishikura: Audrey, thank you very much for coming and taking time from your busy schedule. We really appreciate having you. And we have a lot of questions the we'd like to ask. If you could share your experiences, I think it will be great.

## オードリー氏が考えるDX推進における本質とは

Ishikura: As a starter, I think the Japanese government has been getting involved and encouraging DX, digital transformation. At the same time, I hear that a lot of companies and private sector is making DX as a big, big slogan, so to speak. And for the government, we have set up a new agency exclusively for digitalization and we do have a minister in charge of it. And private sector is doing a lot of things depending upon what kind of industry and what kind of companies they are. But at the same time, I'm a little bit concerned that, while we have been advocating this concept quite extensively, when it comes to whether that is going to be implemented, if that leads to a tangible output. I have a little bit of a concern because we are very good at advocating and proposing but yet we have a little bit of behind in turns of implementation. So let me start off with the question of what are the critical elements to make digital transformation produce the result and make it happen.

Tang: Certainly. I thank you for your call for the question. My job as a digital minister is not an IT minister and I also make this clarification to the Japanese media because they used to call me the *IT大臣* (IT minister), right? And the difference is that IT connects machines and digital connects people. So the necessary critical elements of digital transformation is not to confuse it with IT. If the work that you do, brings people together, give voice to people who didn't have voice, make participation bi-directional, omni-directional, multi-directional, rather than just people listening to one of two radio or TV stations. So one, increase the symmetry and bit rate of participation and engagement than you are on the right path in digitalization. Otherwise, if you connect everything but listening to still only one or two persons speak and every body just listen, that may be digitization but it's not digitalization. It is not truly digital.

Ishikura: I think one of the things you mentioned, and I watched your video as well as read your book, and some of the things that seem to be missing, particularly in Japan, is that you talk about four pilers, and particularly these days, sustainability, innovation, and inclusion. And inclusion part is, as you mentioned, sharing, just making sure that every body is involved rather than one or two people, is critical. And yet, I don't really see that clearly in Japan. How do you make sure that inclusion is everybody's business.

Tang: This is a great question. In Taiwan, what we are doing is making sure that even people who are not of the voting age, younger than 18 years old, have full participation rights through digital platform to initiate, for example, petitions that calls for banning plastic straws on bubble tea drinks. That started by a 16 years old. When I asked her why are you starting this movement, she said this is like our civic class assignment. So, inclusion begins with the basic education. And I think it also extends to life-long education because we see the most active groups on our participation platform are 16 and 17 years old and 60 and 70 years old. So the hair and young people are the two natural groups that care more about sustainability, about future generations. So if you make sure that these two groups of people are in natural partnership with one another, you are of a good start in inclusion.

Ishikura: You mentioned that inclusion starts very early age, at school, around 16 years old -- I'm talking about the straw. Is there any way that we can accelerate that? It means that we really have to work on education in early stage and that's gonna take a little while for us to see the concept of inclusion to be instilled in the younger generation kids, for example. So, is there any way that we can just kind of fast-track?

Tang: Yeah, definitely. I'm sure that in Japan there's also plenty of very young people, maybe they are just 14, maybe they are just 15, are already starting very good social movements, social entrepreneurship, and so on. So in Taiwan, our fast-track is just to invite these young people to into the cabinet level youth advisory council. And this council, very interestingly, all appoints people younger than 35, some of them are in 20s. But they are already quit well-known online. And by calling them reverse mentors, advisor to the cabinet, they get this natural position that goes against the exiting discrimination based on age. Because, instead of calling them "young friends," we call them "advisor," right? Actually, the 16-year-old girls that started the petitions is now 19 years old and she is already an advisor in the committee of national open government partnership, national action plan committee. So, I would call her the counselor, Counselor Wong. Even though she is not technically speaking fully an adult, yet.

Ishikura: A couple of questions. In order to make sure that young people are given a position or assigned to a position of making decisions, we need the exiting leadership group to change their mindset or whatever, willing to make sure that will involve these people with new ideas. I'm sure that's not that easy because they have the best of interest. Their reference point maybe much more with their own experiences rather than today's digital native. How can we convince, or do we need to convince these leaders of today?

Tang: This is where the partnership with silver haired people begins to show its importance. The young people have this support of the 80-years old, like grandma is 88 years old. Then those elderly people can actually speak with authority about the necessity of including young people. One concrete example is that, every year our office hires very young people, some of them are like 18 years old, into our internship program. Initially, all they did is to help government web services work across browsers. Because many older people, they are not that versed with keyboard or Internet Explorer. They are more versed with their phones or more natural ways of using tablets and so on, touch screen. But the government web service was not initially designed for that. Maybe they were designed for ActiveX or something like that. So, for the first couple of years, all the young interns did is to make our government web site accessible especially to the elderly people who rely more on touch screen and speech interfaces. That won the support of elderly people. And the carrier public service and the leaderships see the young people as someone assists, not just criticizes. That built a very good intergeneration authoritarity.
