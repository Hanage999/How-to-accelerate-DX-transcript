Ishikura: Audrey, thank you very much for coming and taking time from your busy schedule. We really appreciate having you. And we have a lot of questions the we'd like to ask. If you could share your experiences, I think it will be great.

## オードリー氏が考えるDX推進における本質とは

Ishikura: As a starter, I think the Japanese government has been getting involved and encouraging DX, digital transformation. At the same time, I hear that a lot of companies and private sector is making DX as a big, big slogan, so to speak. And for the government, we have set up a new agency exclusively for digitalization and we do have a minister in charge of it. And private sector is doing a lot of things depending upon what kind of industry and what kind of companies they are. But at the same time, I'm a little bit concerned that, while we have been advocating this concept quite extensively, when it comes to whether that is going to be implemented, if that leads to a tangible output. I have a little bit of a concern because we are very good at advocating and proposing but yet we have a little bit of behind in turns of implementation. So let me start off with the question of what are the critical elements to make digital transformation produce the result and make it happen.

Tang: Certainly. I thank you for your call for the question. My job as a digital minister is not an IT minister and I also make this clarification to the Japanese media because they used to call me the *IT大臣* (IT minister), right? And the difference is that IT connects machines and digital connects people. So the necessary critical elements of digital transformation is not to confuse it with IT. If the work that you do, brings people together, give voice to people who didn't have voice, make participation bi-directional, omni-directional, multi-directional, rather than just people listening to one of two radio or TV stations. So one, increase the symmetry and bit rate of participation and engagement than you are on the right path in digitalization. Otherwise, if you connect everything but listening to still only one or two persons speak and every body just listen, that may be digitization but it's not digitalization. It is not truly digital.

Ishikura: I think one of the things you mentioned, and I watched your video as well as read your book, and some of the things that seem to be missing, particularly in Japan, is that you talk about four pilers, and particularly these days, sustainability, innovation, and inclusion. And inclusion part is, as you mentioned, sharing, just making sure that every body is involved rather than one or two people, is critical. And yet, I don't really see that clearly in Japan. How do you make sure that inclusion is everybody's business.

Tang: This is a great question. In Taiwan, what we are doing is making sure that even people who are not of the voting age, younger than 18 years old, have full participation rights through digital platform to initiate, for example, petitions that calls for banning plastic straws on bubble tea drinks. That started by a 16 years old. When I asked her why are you starting this movement, she said this is like our civic class assignment. So, inclusion begins with the basic education. And I think it also extends to life-long education because we see the most active groups on our participation platform are 16 and 17 years old and 60 and 70 years old. So the hair and young people are the two natural groups that care more about sustainability, about future generations. So if you make sure that these two groups of people are in natural partnership with one another, you are of a good start in inclusion.
