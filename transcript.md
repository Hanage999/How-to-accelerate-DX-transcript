Ishikura: Audrey, thank you very much for coming and taking time from your busy schedule. We really appreciate having you. And we have a lot of questions the we'd like to ask. If you could share your experiences, I think it will be great. As a starter, I think the Japanese government has been getting involved and encouraging DX, digital transformation. At the same time, I hear that a lot of companies and private sector is making DX as a big, big slogan, so to speak. And for the government, we have set up a new agency exclusively for digitalization and we do have a minister in charge of it. And private sector is doing a lot of things depending upon what kind of industry and what kind of companies they are. But at the same time, I'm a little bit concerned that, while we have been advocating this concept quite extensively, when it comes to whether that is going to be implemented, if that leads to a tangible output. I have a little bit of a concern because we are very good at advocating and proposing but yet we have a little bit of behind in turns of implementation. So let me start off with the question of what are the critical elements to make digital transformation produce the result and make it happen.
